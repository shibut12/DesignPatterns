# Creational patterns
These are the design patterns that deal with __Object creation mechanisms__. The basic form of creating objects sometimes could result in design problems or add complecity to the design. The _Creational deisgn patterns_ solve these issues by controlling the object creation.

There are 5 well known design patterns in Creational design patterns.
* Abstract Factory - Provides an interface for creating dependant objects without specifying underlysing concrete classes.
* Builder - Separates the constructions of a complex object from its representation, so that same contruction process can create different representations
* Factory method - Allows a class to defer instantiation into subclasses
* Prototype - Specifies the kind of object to create using prototypical instance and creates new objects by cloning this prototype
* Singleton - Ensures that a class only has one instance and provides a global point of access to it
